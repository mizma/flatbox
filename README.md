# Flatbox-ACR

![Logo](logo.svg)

_**Low profile hitbox-layout fightstick with Acrylic shell**_

_**STILL A DESIGN IN PROGRESS!! FILES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR OTHERWISE MAY BE DEFECTIVE IN DESIGN**_

This flatbox-acr design is based on [jfedor2/flatbox](https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox) but with a few tweaks
(rev1.1 pcb has been redone from ground up):

* Replaced the 3D printed case with Acrylic shell, allowing to insert printed artwork.
    * or marvel at the simplistic PCB...
    * Heavily inspired by y [Mille-Feuille](https://pomegd.booth.pm/items/2685530) by [@pomegd](https://twitter.com/pomegd)
* modified button layout to:
    * Accomodate for the clearance needed for acrylic cutting
    * To mimic the layout of the original Hitbox button layout(based off of official stencil)
* Silk screen update
    * Added small logo instead of text (flatbox acr)
    * added legends for each buttons (SQUARE, CIRCLE etc.)
    * moved logo to the bottom edge to minimize see-through when adding artwork on top
* Pattern changes
    * GND Fill
    * add vias to join gnd fill
    * moved traces slightly to avoid GND islands and thin GND fills
    * added reset button for Pro Micro board
* Remodeled Button Caps to accomodate for the increased case-height

Final product when assembled will look something like the following:

You can print any fan art using the [Stencil](hardware-rev1.1/images/Flatbox-ACR-Stencil_300dpi.png) 
to customize the looks as well.
