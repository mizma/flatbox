# Flatbox-ACR rev1

_**UNFINISHED DESIGN, Use the [Rev1.1](../hardware-rev1.1/) hardware instead**_

This was an attempt to creating Flatbox-ACR by fiddling with the original Flatbox Rev 1.1 design.
But changing the button layouts to match the original Hitbox design turned out to be more work than just starting from scratch so this revision was abandoned.
